## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `drain_max` (berth.toml) and `berth run --drain-max DURATION`: a ceiling
  on how long a drain waits at a boundary (a busy slot, a running ComfyUI
  job) before it runs the normal stop ladder; 0 = unbounded, the default.
  While a boundary is busy the wrapper prints a line each minute naming
  the slots and the wait age, and the ceiling says so when it ends the
  wait.

### Changed

### Fixed

## [v0.2.0] - 2026-10-19

### Added

- Holds and claims: games and other apps get the card while they run, and
  Steam, Lutris and gamescope are covered out of the box.
  [#22](https://github.com/T-Crypt/berth/pull/22)
- The Windows node, experimental: process attribution, claims and
  job-object drains work today. [#23](https://github.com/T-Crypt/berth/pull/23)
- `berth skill install`: an agent skill that teaches coding agents to ask
  Berth for the card instead of killing GPU processes.
  [#24](https://github.com/T-Crypt/berth/pull/24)
- A reader for voice engines, starting with Kokoro-FastAPI.
  [#25](https://github.com/T-Crypt/berth/pull/25)
- `berth pull hf:ORG/REPO` and `berth verify`: Hugging Face downloads with
  a resume, checked byte for byte against the size and sha256 the Hub
  publishes. [#26](https://github.com/T-Crypt/berth/pull/26)
- `berth models`: the model library on disk, GGUF headers, and the
  `berth models export ollama` conversion.
  [#28](https://github.com/T-Crypt/berth/pull/28)
- The gateway's wake page: a bookmark to a stopped engine's web UI that
  shows who holds the card and starts it, plus `drain_slots` so servers
  with `/slots` hand off at their request boundary.
  [#30](https://github.com/T-Crypt/berth/pull/30)
- Shelves for models (chat, image, audio), `berth storage` with each root's
  filesystem and free-space floor, and `berth pull civitai:VERSION_ID` with
  the site's own hashes. [#33](https://github.com/T-Crypt/berth/pull/33)
- The ComfyUI suite commands: `berth engine install`, `update`, `show`,
  `rollback` and `remove`, with the git-pinned components and the trailing
  model-roots rewrite. [#34](https://github.com/T-Crypt/berth/pull/34)
- The gateway's gui plane index, every engine with its state and its launch
  button. [#35](https://github.com/T-Crypt/berth/pull/35)

### Changed

- The README leads with what Berth does and documents the model library.
  [#27](https://github.com/T-Crypt/berth/pull/27)
- Fresh visuals: an animated banner, a how-it-works diagram and a shorter
  first screen. [#31](https://github.com/T-Crypt/berth/pull/31)
- The harbor interface polish: one head rhythm, one KPI grid on every
  screen, touch-sized phone layout and a documents-first nav.
  [#32](https://github.com/T-Crypt/berth/pull/32)

### Fixed

- `berth run` reads an engine's settings from berth.toml, and a flag set by
  hand still wins. [#36](https://github.com/T-Crypt/berth/pull/36)

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-10-11

Berth v0.1.0: the VRAM leasing service for every GPU you run. Leases with
priorities, the measured release (a grant only after the driver shows the
memory free), stuck and contested detection, unprotected runs, the event
log, the harbor web UI and the first engine readers.
